## 0x15.C - File I/O

#### General

* How to create, open, close, read and write files
* What are file descriptors
* What are the 3 standard file descriptors, what are their purpose and what are their POSIX names
* How to use the I/O system calls open, close, read and write
* What are and how to use the flags O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR
* What are file permissions, and how to set them when creating a file with the open system call
* What is a system call
* What is the difference between a function and a system call

### Tasks:
#### 0. Tread lightly, she is near
* Write a function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.
* Prototype: ssize_t read_textfile(const char *filename, size_t letters);
* where letters is the number of letters it should read and print
* returns the actual number of letters it could read and print
* if the file can not be opened or read, return 0
* if filename is NULL return 0
* if write fails or does not write the expected amount of bytes, return 0.
#### 1. Under the snow
* Create a function that creates a file.

* Prototype: int create_file(const char *filename, char *text_content);
* where filename is the name of the file to create and text_content is a NULL terminated string to write to the file
* Returns: 1 on success, -1 on failure (file can not be created, file can not be written, write “fails”, etc…)
* The created file must have those permissions: rw-------. If the file already exists, do not change the permissions.
* if the file already exists, truncate it
* if filename is NULL return -1
* if text_content is NULL create an empty file
